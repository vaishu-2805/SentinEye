## Virtual Environment

This project uses a Python virtual environment located in the `env` directory. This directory should not be tracked by version control.

To set up the environment, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
python -m venv env
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1   # for Windows PowerShell
# or
.\env\Scripts\activate.bat   # for Windows Command Prompt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

All the provided batch files will automatically check for and use the Python virtual environment.

## How It Works

### Face Detection
The base version uses the Haar Cascade classifier from OpenCV, which is a machine learning-based approach where a cascade function is trained from many positive and negative images. It's particularly efficient for face detection.

The advanced security version also implements Deep Neural Network (DNN) based face detection from OpenCV, which provides better accuracy and robustness compared to Haar Cascade, especially in challenging lighting conditions and different face orientations.

### Skeleton Detection
The enhanced version implements YOLO (You Only Look Once) v11 pose detection:
1. **Real-time Detection**: Identifies human body key points in the video stream
2. **Pose Estimation**: Maps the skeletal structure of detected persons
3. **Visualization**: Overlays skeleton visualization on the camera feed
4. **Result**: Adds another layer of security monitoring through body pose analysis

### Kalman Filter Tracking
The advanced security version implements a full Kalman filter for face tracking:
1. **Prediction**: Predicts where faces should be in the next frame
2. **Measurement**: Measures actual face positions in the current frame
3. **Update**: Refines the prediction based on measurement
4. **Result**: Smooth tracking of faces across frames, even during brief occlusions

### Anti-Spoofing
The anti-spoofing features help detect attempts to fool the system with photos or fake faces:
1. **Blink Detection**: Monitors eye regions for natural blinking patterns
2. **Texture Analysis**: Analyzes facial texture to detect printed photos or screens
3. **Result**: Increased security against presentation attacks and identity fraud

### ATM Security System
The security prototype implements a multi-threaded architecture:
1. **Main Thread**: Handles the Tkinter UI (keypad window)
2. **Background Thread**: Processes camera frames and detects faces
3. **Thread Communication**: Uses Queue for thread-safe data exchange
4. **Event System**: Coordinates between security monitoring and UI

This architecture ensures the application remains responsive while performing intensive face detection operations in the background.

The basic process for both versions:
1. Captures video from your webcam
2. Converts each frame to grayscale
3. Applies the face detection algorithm
4. Draws rectangles around detected faces
5. Displays the processed frame with face counts and FPS

### Eye Detection (Advanced Version)
The advanced version also uses a Haar Cascade classifier specifically trained for eye detection. For each detected face:
1. A region of interest (ROI) is extracted from the face area
2. The eye detection algorithm is applied to this region
3. Rectangles are drawn around detected eyes

### Screenshots (Advanced Version)
The advanced version allows you to capture screenshots by pressing the 's' key:
1. Screenshots are saved to the 'screenshots' directory (created automatically)
2. Files are named with a timestamp (e.g., 'face_tracker_20230615_120530.jpg')
3. The format can be configured (JPG or PNG)

## Troubleshooting

- If the webcam doesn't open, check that your camera is connected and not being used by another application
- If face detection is not working well, try adjusting the `scale_factor` and `min_neighbors` parameters
- For better performance on slower computers, try reducing the `frame_width` and `frame_height`

## Further Extensions

Some ideas for further extending this application:

- Add face recognition to identify specific people
- Track faces across frames to assign consistent IDs
- Add emotion detection to recognize facial expressions
- Implement facial landmark detection (nose, mouth, etc.)
- Add age and gender estimation
- Create a recording feature to save video
- Implement motion detection to only track when movement occurs
- Add a GUI for adjusting settings without modifying code
